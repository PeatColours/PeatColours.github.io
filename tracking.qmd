**The Tracking the Colour of Peatland project** uses community science to collect photographs of wetlands and peatlands over the course of the year from publicly accessible sites.

Any time someone visits a site, they can take a fixed-point photograph of the wetland using one of the specially designed phone cradles and send the photograph over. This allows us to build up a picture of how these wetlands change over the course of the year with regards to their colour.

We have 22 sites in the project currently. You can access the photographs using the map below:
